# Investigating Myonuclear Diversity in Mouse Muscle Using Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing
## Introduction
Skeletal muscle fibers are multinucleated structures, each housing multiple myonuclei that are crucial for muscle integrity and functionality. Recent advancements in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) have illuminated the non-uniform nature of these myonuclei, revealing distinct subtypes tailored for specific functions, such as muscle growth, repair, and metabolic processes. This study aims to leverage snRNA-seq to analyze muscle samples from male and female mice across eight genetically diverse strains, which include five classical inbred strains (C57BL6/6, A/J, NOD/ShLtj, NZO/HILtJ, 129S1/SvlmJ) and three wild-derived strains (PWK/PhJ, WSB/EiJ, and CAST/EiJ). The goal is to understand how genetic factors influence the diversity and functionality of myonuclei, ultimately enhancing our understanding of muscle biology.

For this project, I will utilize snRNA-seq datasets generated via Illumina sequencing, focusing on muscle nuclei from the aforementioned strains. This dataset will facilitate expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, allowing for the analysis of genetic variations that affect gene expression in muscle cells. Data will be sourced from a combination of lab-generated sequences and established repositories, providing a comprehensive basis for exploring myonuclear diversity and genetic influences on muscle physiology.

The analysis will include clustering gene expression profiles from snRNA-seq data to categorize distinct myonuclear subtypes, enabling identification of key cell populations within muscle. I will perform differential gene expression analysis to examine variations across strains and sexes, aiming to identify genes influenced by genetic and sex-based factors. Additionally, eQTL mapping will be conducted to link genetic variants to expression differences within myonuclear subtypes, offering insights into genotype-phenotype relationships.

## Proposed Analyses and Visualizations

To address these research questions, I will implement a bioinformatics strategy that includes:
- **Clustering gene expression profiles:** This will help pinpoint myonuclear subtypes.
- **Differential gene expression analysis:** This will assess variations by sex and strain.


Visualization techniques will include:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** This will aid in exploring and categorizing myonuclear subtypes based on gene expression data, laying the groundwork for further analysis.
- **Heatmaps:** These will illustrate gene expression profiles across identified myonuclear subtypes.
- **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plots:** These will provide dimensionality reduction, highlighting clusters of myonuclear subtypes.
- **Bar charts:** These will compare the distribution of myonuclear subtypes across strains and sexes.
- **Violin plots:** These will visualize gene expression variations across different strains.

## Conclusion

This project is feasible due to the robust dataset available from the IGVF consortium, which includes high-resolution snRNA-seq data across eight mouse strains and both sexes. Using established bioinformatics tools like Seurat, I can efficiently perform gene clustering and differential expression analyses. The project's focused scope—targeting muscle-related genes and myonuclear subtypes—ensures manageability within the course timeframe, while clear visualizations such as UMAP plots and heatmaps facilitate straightforward interpretation and communication of results. Altogether, the combination of accessible data, proven tools, and a streamlined analytical approach guarantees that the project is both achievable and impactful.
